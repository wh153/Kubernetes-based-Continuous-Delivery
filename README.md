# Kubernetes-based-Continuous-Delivery

This is a repository for the second project of IDS 721 Clouding computing. 


Using AWS cloud9 as development environment and github as source control, we create a microservice for two calculations utilizing recursion and dynamic programming, which is simialr to project 1.


## Project2 implementation & Workflow
First, An AWS Cloud9 environment supported by EC2 instance is created for this assignment.

Then the calculator is implemented.

A FastAPI is built for providing the micro-service.

A Docker Image is built holding all the dependencies.

The Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is used for storing the image.

The service is a Kubernetes based service containing Continuous Delivery.

CI/CD workflow is built in this assignment
